## Get a free workshop for your team

 We have a series of workshop that we have prepared, and done publicly and for free. Despite that they are free in the literal meaning "costless" they are not cheap in the meaning "inferior" or "low quality". Quite the opposite, they showcase the seriousness and high quality we aim for in our engagements.

We offer them as a private V.I.P. session. Only condition is that sign up min 6 people (no max!) and that you set aside time to both prepare well before the workshop, and evaluate with us after.

Browse some of the options you have in our [event page](https://www.thetechcollective.dev/events/).

We can either host it in one of our historical buildings in Hellerup or Copenhagen,  or we can come to you, or if distance permits us to meet easily we can offer them in an online format.

Hit the button to see when we have available slots and find one that suits you and your team, and we will get back to you straight away so we can settle on meeting and content details.
