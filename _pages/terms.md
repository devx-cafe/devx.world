## Privacy Policy

This site is operated from an obligation and dedication to protect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of it's user's data, including personal data. We are continuously working on ensuring compliance with applicable data protection legislation, first and foremost the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## .tech-that as a community - not a business

This is a community driven `.club` site. On these pages each author speaks with her or his own tone-of-voice. On these pages the editors are dedicated to hosting a community - not running a business. All material on theses pages is free.

The main purpose is to expose our _personal_ passion for utilizing technology and digital solutions to drive meaningful outcomes for people. We love to share our knowledge and experience with others. Most people in tech do. Therefore our stories have discussions enabled, and you are encouraged to join and set your mark - all it takes is a GitHub Account.

## Data controller

When the .tech-that community processes data, we consider ourselves a data processor, since we process personal data on behalf of our readers and users.

Our policy on maintaining this role is based on the EU commission's [adequacy decision](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3721){: target="_blank"} which clarifies that for US companies that has signed the EU-US [Data Privacy Framework program](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/]{: target="_blank"} and which offers [Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC)](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en){: target="_blank"}
that have been “pre-approved” by the European Commission, the legal implication of utilizing services from US based companies is considered _adequate_ to be fully comparable with that of obtaining similar services from EU based companies.

We carefully monitor, that we do not utilize services from US based companies unless they have signed the Data Privacy Framework program.

Currently the .tech-that community utilizes services from GitHub, Meetup, Microsoft and Google. They have all entered the Data Privacy Framework program.

## we do not collect any PII data

Personally identifiable information (PII) is any data that can be used to identify someone. On this specific low-fidelity site we do use cookies to track how our guests use our website, but we have anonymized all data and we do not elicit _any_ kind of PII data; We're here to share knowledge and insights - not to collect data!
