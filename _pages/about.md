**We are a tribe of agile teams with a passion for utilizing technology and digital solutions to drive meaningful outcomes. We are a collective of technologists, developers, testers, engineers, designers and enthusiasts who love to share our knowledge and experience with others.**

And we're powered by Implement. That is; we're part of [Implement Management Consulting](https://implementconsultinggroup.com/){: target="_blank"} where we specialize in deep tech. You can say that we're the _tech artisans_ of Implement.

The Tech Collective is an umbrella brand, with five self-organized hubs underneath. Each with a dedicated focus:

- Conversational AI solutions
- Test & DevOps - Building Quality In
- S/4HANA
- Salesforce
- Cyber Security
