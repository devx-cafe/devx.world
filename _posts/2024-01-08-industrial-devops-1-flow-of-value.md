The first principle of Industrial DevOps is to visualize and organize around the flow of value instead of around functions. This principle emphasizes the importance of aligning multiple product teams for regular demonstration and [delivery of value][1].

Organizing for flow provides guidance on how to align your multiple product teams for regular demonstration and delivery of value. It is important to identify your value streams, who is involved in each step of your value stream, and make your value stream visible by visually collaborating with your value stream team. Use tooling to gather value stream data and generate insights for your team.

Visualizing the flow of value helps to identify bottlenecks and waste in the process. It also helps to identify areas where improvements can be made. By visualizing the flow of value, you can identify areas where work is being done that does not add value to the customer.

Technology can help to realize this principle by providing tools that enable teams to visualize and collaborate on their value streams. For example, there are many value stream mapping tools available that can help teams to identify their value streams and visualize the flow of value. These tools can also help teams to identify bottlenecks and waste in the process, and to identify areas where improvements can be made.

In addition, technology can help teams to gather data on their value streams and generate insights for their team. For example, there are many analytics tools available that can help teams to gather data on their value streams and generate insights on how to [improve their processes][2].

By leveraging technology to visualize and organize around the flow of value, teams can improve their processes and deliver more value to their customers.
