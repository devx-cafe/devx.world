Both _Community of Practice (CoP)_ and _Legitimate Peripheral Participation (LPP)_ are concepts within didactics, first coined by Lave & Wenger in "Situated Learning" (1991) and later unfolded by Wenger in "Communities of Practice" (1998). In short a Community of Practice is an informal group of professionals, newcomers, old-timers and everything in between. Who take interest in the same domain and interact, engage and share activities. Legitimate peripheral participation underlines the fact that this community is friendly and allows participation from everyone who defines themselves as a member. It's about in-situ hands-on learning.

With focus on _learning_, not _teaching_.

We have taken the initiative to host a series of informal events where you - and everyone else with an interest in _FlowTech_ and _Contemporary DevOps_ are welcomed into our beautiful surroundings: The old girl school for daughters of naval officers in Nyboder in Copenhagen city and the original Tuborg brewery headquarter in Hellerup. Those two historic buildings alone are worth a visit.
