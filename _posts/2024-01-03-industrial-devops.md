Hello, readers! Today, I'm going to share with you a summary of an insightful book, "Industrial DevOps: Build Better Systems Faster" by Dr. Suzette Johnson and Robin Yeman¹. This book provides a comprehensive guide on how to apply Agile and DevOps principles in the development of cyber-physical systems².

## What is Industrial DevOps?

Industrial DevOps is the application of Lean, Agile, and DevOps principles to the planning, development, manufacturing, deployment, and serviceability of significant cyber-physical systems². It bridges the principles and practices of Agile, Lean, and DevOps with the unique needs and challenges of cyber-physical systems².

## The Nine Principles of Industrial DevOps

The authors have identified nine key principles that are effective in successfully delivering cyber-physical systems across industries²:

1. **Organize for the Flow of Value**: Align your multiple product teams for regular demonstration and delivery of value².
2. **Apply Multiple Horizons of Planning**: Address scaling and complexity while leveraging ongoing experimentation and learning².
3. **Implement Data-Driven Decisions**: Use current observations and metrics to manage the flow of work across systems of systems, and continuously improve with real-time data².
4. **Architect for Change and Speed**: Reduce dependencies and improve the speed of change².
5. **Iterate, Manage Queues, Create Flow**: Emphasize the importance of fast feedback, experimentation, and continuous learning².
6. **Establish Cadence and Synchronization for Flow**: Reduce variability and improve predictability².
7. **Integrate Early and Often**: Cover different levels and types of integration points across large, complex systems².
8. **Shift Left**: Emphasize a “test-first” mindset encompassing the multiple levels of testing across cyber-physical systems².
9. **Apply a Growth Mindset**: Continuously learn, innovate, and adapt to the changes around us in order to stay competitive².

## Conclusion

The book "Industrial DevOps: Build Better Systems Faster" provides a comprehensive and actionable guide, empowering organizations to establish teams and capabilities that surpass the competition in both insight and agility¹. It's a must-read for anyone interested in the application of Agile and DevOps principles in the development of cyber-physical systems².
