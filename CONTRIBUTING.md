## The basics

This web page is generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) a multi-compliler that builds `html` from  `MarkDown` and `Liquid` and builds `CSS`from `SASS`. Plain and simple. It's based on a remote template [`thetechcollective/minimal-mistake`](https://github.com/thetechcollective/minimal-mistakes) which is forked from [`mmistakes/minimal-mistakes`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). The template is documented at [_Minimal Mistake's Quick Start Guide_](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/). We support all the features documented here - and a few more.

Jekyll is originally developed by GitHub with the specific purpose of supporting [GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll).

The codebase is automatically build every time a commit hist the `main` branch - Have a look at [the actions](https://github.com/thetechcollective/thetechcollective.dev/actions).

The build is verified, in the same pipeline and if all checks out it's automatically deployed to [www.thetechcollective.dev](https://www.thetechcollective.dev).

If you need help with _anything_ that is not documente here, feel free to ask in the [discussions](https://github.com/thetechcollective/thetechcollective.dev/discussions), that we have opend on this repository. Or to open an [issue](https://github.com/thetechcollective/thetechcollective.dev/issues) on the same repository.



## Getting Acccess

- You need to be a member of the organisation [@thetechcollective](https://github.com/thetechcollective/)
- You need to become a member of the [webdev team](https://github.com/orgs/thetechcollective/teams/webdev)


Contact @lakruzz - either by a mentinon on a discussion or issue her in GitHub or on mail [lakr@thetechcollective.ex](mailto:lakr@thetechcollective.ex)

## Start with creating a CodeSpace

Create a CodeSpace on [this repostitory](https://github.com/thetechcollective/thetechcollective.dev) The build takes a while first time you do it.

## Build the website

Run the following in the terminal

```ruby
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

All changes will become instantly live on the dev site on port 4000 (except changes in `.yml` files, they require the server to be stopped an restarted.

When you commit changes back to master and push to `origin` the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/thetechcollective/thetechcollective.dev/actions) will automatically start. If your code pass the quality gates, it will end up on the live website at [www.thetechcollective.dev](https://www.thetechcollective.dev)

## Quality gates

The workflow will build the site with `jekyll` and then test for spelling error and correct MarkDown formatting. using `cspell` and `markdownlint-cli2`

![workflow](https://github.com/thetechcollective/thetechcollective.dev/assets/155492/bf4f56f0-18d3-4270-95c0-aea0276034f3)

If you want to test in your dev setup wether or not the workflow will pass the quality gates keep an eye on the _Problems_ tab in the terminal window or you can run the same commands as the worflow executes [`cspell "_*/**.md"`](https://github.com/thetechcollective/thetechcollective.dev/blob/6b42bbcbec89d873ab04839fb7144807560761c8/.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml#L58-L59) and [`run: markdownlint-cli2 "_*/**.md"`](https://github.com/thetechcollective/thetechcollective.dev/blob/6b42bbcbec89d873ab04839fb7144807560761c8/.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml#L69-L70) respectively. In the terminal in your CodeSpace it translates to:

``` shell
cspell "_*/**.md"
markdownlint-cli2 "_*/**.md" 
```
