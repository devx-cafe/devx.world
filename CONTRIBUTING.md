# This is not the official website

**The Tech Collective's offical website [www.thetechcollective`.eu`](https://thetechcollective.eu) is managed by Implement Brand and the brand ambassadors from The Tech Collective. This is something entirely different. The repository you are looking at now is the source for the static web hosted at [thetechcollective`.dev`](www.thetechcollective.dev).**

## Why do we need another web?

On these pages each author speaks with her or his own tone-of-voice. Our stories have discussions enabled, so everyone is encouraged to join and set their mark.

ðŸ‘‰ We host tech stories (blog posts)<br/>
ðŸ‘‰ We host public free events<br/>
ðŸ‘‰ We offer free self-paced turotials<br/>
ðŸ‘‰ We promote Open Source products from our GitHub organization<br/>
ðŸ‘‰ The web is programmed (MarkDown, Liquid, JavaScript and SASS)

...and since it's programmed it double both as an internal playground and an external _anything_as-code_ showvcase for: _GitOps_, _Continuous Delivery_, _Declarative Pipelines_,  _Branching Strategies_, _DX - Developer Experience_, _IDP - Internal Development Platform_, _Kanban task management_, _Devcontainers_, _Continuous Integration_, _Build optimization_, _Static Code Analysis_, _Automated testing_ ...

## Who can join?
Any employee in any of the hubs of The Tech Collective is invited and encouraged to contribute. We run this codebase as an Open Source community. So the contributions should be self-explanatory and asyncronous. And subject to automated verification.

All you have to do is read this `CONTRIBUTING.md` instruction and you should be good to go.

## The basics

This web page is generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) a multi-compliler that builds `html` from  `MarkDown` and `Liquid` and builds `CSS`from `SASS`. Plain and simple. It's based on a remote template [`thetechcollective/minimal-mistake`](https://github.com/thetechcollective/minimal-mistakes) which is forked from [`mmistakes/minimal-mistakes`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). The template is documented at [_Minimal Mistake's Quick Start Guide_](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/). We support all the features documented here - and a few more.

Jekyll is originally developed by GitHub with the specific purpose of supporting [GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll).

The codebase is automatically build every time a commit hist the `main` branch - Have a look at [the actions](https://github.com/thetechcollective/thetechcollective.dev/actions).

The build is verified, in the same pipeline and if all checks out it's automatically deployed to [www.thetechcollective.dev](https://www.thetechcollective.dev).

If you need help with _anything_ that is not documente here, feel free to ask at the [discussions](https://github.com/thetechcollective/thetechcollective.dev/discussions), that we have opend on this repository. Or to open an [issue](https://github.com/thetechcollective/thetechcollective.dev/issues) on the same repository.

## To get access and become a contributor

1. Get write access to this repo - contact @lakruzz to become a member of the @thetechcollective organization on GitHub. You will get an invite, and as soon as you've accepted it you have access to it all. 
2. Open a Code Space on this repo - make sure the `postcreate.sh` script finished, before you continue.
3. Run the following in the terminal

```ruby
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

All changes will become instantly live on the dev site on port 4000 (except changes in `.yml` files, they require the server to be stopped an restarted.

When you commit changes back to master and push to `origin` the GitHub Action will automatically start.

## Quality gates

The workflow will build the site with `jekyll` and then test for spelling error and correct MarkDown formatting. using `cspell` and `markdownlint-cli2`

![workflow](https://github.com/thetechcollective/thetechcollective.dev/assets/155492/bf4f56f0-18d3-4270-95c0-aea0276034f3)

To test in your dev setup if your workflow will pass run

``` shell
cspell "_*/**.md"
markdownlint-cli2 "_*/**.md" 
```
