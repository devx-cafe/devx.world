# This is not the official website

** The Tech Collective's offical website [www.thetechcollective`.eu`](https://thetechcollective.eu) is managed by Implement Brand and the brand ambassadors from The Tech Collective. This is something entirely different. The repository you are looking at now is the source for the static web hosted at [thetechcollective`.dev`](www.thetechcollective.dev).**

## Why do we need another web?

On these pages each author speaks with her or his own tone-of-voice. Our stories have discussions enabled, so everyone is encouraged to join and set their mark.

ðŸ‘‰ We host tech stories (blog posts)<br/>
ðŸ‘‰ We host public free events<br/>
ðŸ‘‰ We offer free self-paced turotials<br/>
ðŸ‘‰ We promote Open Source products from our GitHub organization<br/>
ðŸ‘‰ The web is programmed (MarkDown, Liquid, JavaScript and SCSS)

...and since it's programmed it doubles both as an internal playground and an external _anything_as-code_ showvcase for: _GitOps_, _Continuous Delivery_, _Declarative Pipelines_,  _Branching Strategies_, _DX - Developer Experience_, _IDP - Internal Development Platform_, _Kanban task management_, _Devcontainers_, _Continuous Integration_, _Build optimization_, _Static Code Analysis_, _Automated testing_ ...

## Who can join?
Any employee in any of the hubs of The Tech Collective is invited and encouraged to contribute. We run is as an Open Source community. So the contributions should be self-explanatory and asyncronous.

All you have to do is read this `CONTRIBUTING.md` instruction and you should be good to go.

This web page is generated by Jekyll. It's based on a remote template thetechcollective/minimal-mistake which is forked from mmistakes/minimal-mistakes. The template is documented at <https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/>

It's hosted on GitHub pages.

It's live location is <https://www.thetechcollective.dev>

To contribute:

1. Get write access to this repo - contact @lakruzz
2. Open a Code Space on this repo - make sure the `postcreate.sh` script finished, before you continue.
3. Run the following in the terminal

```ruby

```

All changes will become instantly live on the dev site on port 4000 (except changes in `.yml` files, they require the server to be stopped an restarted.

When you commit back to master and push to `origin` the GitHub Action will automatically deploy it to <https://www.thetechcollective.dev>

## Quality gates

The workflow will build the site with `jekyll` and then test for spelling error and correct MarkDown formatting. using `cspell` and `markdownlint-cli2`

![workflow](https://github.com/thetechcollective/thetechcollective.dev/assets/155492/bf4f56f0-18d3-4270-95c0-aea0276034f3)

To test in your dev setup if your workflow will pass run

``` shell
cspell "_*/**.md"
markdownlint-cli2 "_*/**.md" 
```
