## This is not the official website

**The Tech Collective's official website <https://thetechcollective.eu> is managed by Implement Brand and the brand ambassadors from The Tech Collective. This is something entirely different. The repository you are looking at now is the source for the static web hosted at thetechcollective.dev.**

### Why do we need another web?

On these pages each author speaks with her or his own tone-of-voice. Our stories have discussions enabled, so everyone is encouraged to join and set their mark.

### Who can join?
Any employee in any of the hubs of The Tech Collective is invited and encouraged to contribute. We run this codebase as an Open Source community. So the contributions should be self-explanatory and asynchronous. And subject to automated verification.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to contribute to our repo.
