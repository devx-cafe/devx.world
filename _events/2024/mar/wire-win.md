In Gene Kim and Steven Spear's new bok "Wiring the Winning Organization" they presents a new theory of organizational performance and management, based on decades of research and case studies of high-performing organizations across various industries. The authors argue that the key to achieving excellence is how leaders design their management systems around people’s ingenuity and creativity, and how they integrate individual efforts into a collaborative effort. This is what they call wiring the winning
organization.

The authors explain how organizations can move from the danger zone, where problems are hard to see and
solve, and where people are frustrated and disengaged, to the winning zone, where problems are easy to see
and solve, and where people are empowered and engaged. They introduce three mechanisms to achieve this
transformation: slowification, simplification, and amplification.

- *Slowification*  — means making it easier to solve problems by slowing down the flow of work and creating
feedback loops that allow people to learn and improve.
- *Simplification* — means making problems easier to solve by reducing complexity and variability, and
standardizing work processes and outcomes.
- *Amplification* — means ensuring that problems are seen and solved by creating a culture of transparency,
accountability, and collaboration, and by leveraging technology and data to support problem-solving.
