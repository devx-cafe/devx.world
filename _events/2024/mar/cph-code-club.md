This event is co-organized between **.the tech collective** and **Copenhagen Code Club**. It's hosted at Implement's headquarters in Hellerup.

DX - “Developer Experience” and IDP - “Internal Development Platform” are some of the most consistent and contemporary buzzes on the back of DevOps Classic.

On the programme we have two tech talks, both related to the containerization that is spreading across development teams like a prairie fire these years.

The first talk is is a practical showcase on how to use Devcontainers, GitHub Actions, GitHub CLI, GitHub CoPilot both in CodeSpaces and VS Code to create an Internal Development Platform and improve the Developer Experience.

The second talk is demonstrating the concrete steps and measures required to take your old Virtual Machines to containers in Kubernetes (K8S)

Put the pedal to the metal, and improve your everyday work life as a software developer.

⚠️ There will be running code from stage! ⚠️
