Taking offset in Jeffery Likers 2<sup>nd</sup> edition of "The Toyota Way" we will go through each one of the 14 management principles presented in the book, and through discussions, examples, team work, and real life stories from the trenches we will try to put them in context of today's contemporary buzzes.

_"How is this relevant"_ - you may think?, Here's an input for after-thought: Consider any of the following popular trends or _schools_ in IT and Software.

- _[The Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html){: target="_blank"}_
- _[The Lean Startup method](https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything){: target="_blank"}_
- _[Continuous Delivery](https://www.continuousdelivery.com/){: target="_blank"}_
- _[DevOps](https://dora.dev/devops-capabilities/){: target="_blank"}_
- _[Half Double](https://halfdoubleinstitute.org/the-methodology){: target="_blank"}_
- _[Scrum](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html){: target="_blank"}_

All of these methodologies and many more stand on the shoulders of the classical lean approach, originally coined by Toyota.

> _"The World would not have turned out as we know it today, if it hadn't been for The Toyota Way."_

Perhaps a bold statement, but join us in a workshop, where we will try to untangle these relations and dive into why The Toyota Way stands out an inspire - even if you are not a car manufacturing company.

#### Note

Jeffery's book is quite dense. It's a good read and I highly recommend it, but it's not a prerequisite to have read the book or have any prior knowledge about The Toyota Way to attend this workshop. However, should you want to prepare a bit, then a while back - for educational purpose - I prepared [a short compendium](https://github.com/orgs/kea-dpd/discussions/19) (reading time â‰ˆ15 min).

**We will serve sandwiches, coffee, soda during the event.**
