Taking offset in [Jeffery Likers 2<sup>nd</sup> edition of "The Toyota Way"](https://github.com/orgs/kea-dpd/discussions/19) we will go through each one of the 14 management principles presented in the book, and through discussions, examples, team work, and real life stories from the trenches we will try to put them in context of today's contemporary buzzes. 

Context of: 
- _[The Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)_
- _[The Lean Startup method](https://github.com/orgs/kea-dpd/discussions/17)_
- _[Continuos Delivery and DevOps](https://www.inc-inc.dk/stories/codeu/)_ 
- _[Scrum](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)_
- _[In-bound marketing](https://www.inc-inc.dk/stories/in-bound-in-five/)_

Jeffery's book is really (really) long. It's a good read and I recommend it, but it's not a prerequisite to have read the book to attend this workshop - I've prepared [a short compendium ](https://github.com/orgs/kea-dpd/discussions/19) you can read up on. You may argue that it's not _short_ but it will only take ≈15 minutes to read so compared to the 448 very dense pages in Jefferey's book - it is _relatively_ short. Spending just 15 minutes in preparation, should give you a fair chance to _participate_ as opposes to just _listen in_.

**Preparation:** Non is strictly _required_, but I've prepared a short [compendium](https://github.com/orgs/kea-dpd/discussions/19) (≈15 min read) which I recommend you skim. 

**When does it end:** You are welcome to hang out after pizza and engage in discussions, socialize and mingle - hard deadline (kick out) is ≈ 21:00
